- name:  Application-driven infrastructure with Crossplane 
  description: |
    Crossplane allows users to extend their Kubernetes clusters using CRDs. The CRDs map any infrastructure or managed service, ensuring that the creation process for the users is as simple as the Kubernetes resources creation. Using a collection of YAML manifests, the development teams can assemble the needed cloud services for their applications removing this duty from the operation teams: this is "shift left" at its best. All this powerfulness comes with a cost in terms of security, governance, cognitive load and maintenance. In this talk we'll discuss strategies and techniques to better map the complexity of this infrastructure.

  description: |
    In this talk we will talk about how to ensure the security and quality of the software we deploy on Kubernetes using open-source tools like Sigstore, Kyverno and Syft/Grype. We will explain what a secure supply chain is, why it is important and how to implement it with these tools. We will also show you how to generate and verify SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) of your OCI (Open Container Initiative) artifacts. And finally, we will show you some practical examples of how to use these technologies in action. We hope you enjoy it and find it useful!

- name: Observability for You and Me with OpenTelemetry
  description: |
    Are you interested in dipping your toes in the cloud native observability waters, but as an engineer you are not sure where to get started with tracing your microservices and applications on Kubernetes? Then this is the session for you, where we take you on your first steps in an active open-source project that offers a buffet of opportunities for getting started with telemetry data. The project, openTelemetry (OTEL), is where we start with de-mystifying key concepts and terms such as observability, telemetry, instrumentation to lay a foundation. Then we’ll explore the OTEL community and how to become not only an end-user, but possibly a contributor.We will wrap up with an overview of the components in this project, such as the Collector, the OTEL protocol (OTLP), its APIs, and its SDKs. Attendees will leave with an understanding of key observability concepts in distributed tracing!

- name: From Perimeter to Zero Trust - Securing Kubernetes with Paralus
  description: |
    From monoliths to microservices, VMs to containers, the way we run and deploy our applications today has evolved over the years. Hence the way we safeguard our applications should also evolve. In this talk, I'll talk about how securing infrastructure has evolved and moved away from traditional perimeter-based security to robust and agile zero trust. Will introduce Zero Trust and its principles and touch upon the differences between the various security options to secure your Kubernetes clusters. We will then look at how Paralus can help secure access to your Kubernetes clusters with a quick hands-on demo.

  description: |
    Multiple microservices, complex architecture, and recurring performance issues. This lack of visibility hampers a team's ability to troubleshoot effectively, leading to prolonged downtime & frustrated customers. But what if there was a way to unravel the mystery of your service mesh and ensure it's always performing at its best? In this talk, we'll shed some light on service mesh observability and reliability. We'll then see how advanced technologies like Chaos Engineering can help make our service mesh more reliable. To showcase how this would work, we'll have a demo of using Litmus Chaos along with Kiali to observe our service mesh and in turn, take preventive measures to make it more reliable. So, don't let your service mesh be a mystery any longer - attend the talk and learn how to make it more observable and reliable than ever before!

- name: WTF Are Inclusive Communities and How to Maintain Them?
  description: |
    We are all here thanks to Cloud Native communities. Some of you might aspire to build tech communities that are diverse, open, inclusive and safe. Even if you are not planning to build a new community, you probably wish to belong to one with these characteristics. And while Cloud Native brought us all together, it doesn’t mean that we can feel safe to openly share and learn. That’s when reflecting on values collaboratively becomes crucial. It goes beyond abiding by a CoC or building a diverse line-up: it makes us part of the process and it makes us accountable for the values themselves. In this talk Carla and Jade will share a real life example on how they mapped out the personal values of several teams, to create a shared value system for their internal community to follow and belong to. A system that was also expressed externally through the voice of their WTF is Cloud Native brand.

- name: Propagating Programming Paradigms - Lifting High Performance Compute Into K8s
  description: |
    Users don’t care where items run, just IF they run and how long they need to wait for completion. We should be building systems where ONLY the hardware, network, storage, and security engineers worry about how to maximally leverage underlying hardware for performance. Increasingly popular AI/ML and traditional HPC workloads have many similarities. It is historically difficult for the users to deploy their workloads in HPC environments. Kubernetes, meanwhile, has focused on simplifying the cognitive load for the users at a cost to both performance and sustainability. We show how to lift paradigms from HPC to make more performant Kubernetes clusters. We give a history of where HPC has come up short in abstracting hardware away from the user. We highlight current Kubernetes projects that do aid in performance in a cloud-native fashion and will go over continuing gaps. We will show how to improve Kubernetes to optimize both performance and sustainability without added pain to the user.

  description: |
    The Kubernetes Steering Committee is tasked with decision-making and oversight of the non-technical aspects of the Kubernetes project. This session will be broken into two parts: The first half will be an overview of what the committee is, and what it isn’t. What it’s tasked with, its importance, what it has accomplished to date and its top priorities for the year. The latter half will be focused on answering questions from Kubernetes project constituents and the wider Cloud Native community at large. If you’re curious or have a question about how one of the largest Open Source projects is governed, how that impacts you, or how you can leverage our learnings in your cloud-native projects’ governance journeys, we encourage you to come stop by for a conversation! NOTE: Had to swap speakers at the last minute (covid).

  description: |
    The Cloud Native ecosystem is a complex topic. While most things start with Kubernetes as a foundation, a stack can vary wildly, even when sticking only to CNCF-accepted projects. In addition to the technical aspects, there’s also community, docs, and governance to be aware of when looking to contribute (and often even consume) these technologies. Never fear, for Bob Killen (Google) and Jeffrey Sica (CNCF) are here to provide attendees a map of the land(scape). Both have been active consumers of, and contributors to, CNCF projects for years. In this talk, Bob and Jeff will guide attendees through what a Cloud Native stack looks like, the common problems that different projects look to solve, and how Community plays a big part in this technology.

    Coincidentally, both have also been residents of Southeastern Michigan for most of their lives! Therefore the talk will be chalked full of analogies to Detroit Style Pizza, Coney Dogs, and Automobiles to celebrate their home state and the wonderful city of Detroit.

  description: |
    In Crossplane, deploying resources using GitOps (ArgoCD) is straightforward, but disaster recovery is a different ballgame. When calamity hits, you can't just spin up a new Kubernetes cluster, point it to your Git repository, and expect a 'magical' restoration. This talk will demystify the notion that disaster recovery is 'magic' by exploring various strategies tailored for different levels of disasters using Velero.

- name: "Automate secret rotation in Kubernetes, then get out of the way!"
  description: |
    Industry best practices say that we should rotate secrets frequently to ensure our systems and data stay safe, but doing that in an operationally safe way is often a challenge.
    Not only that, but due to the vast number of regulations and compliance requirements, different secret management solutions, even figuring out where to start can be hard.

    In his presentation, Mark will provide guidance to understand the landscape of secret management and rotation solutions in Kubernetes and will show you how to set up and operate them in a safe and reliable,
    but more importantly, automated way. You might have seen Mark's presentation about the same subject at FOSDEM '23.
    Due to time constraints that was a brief, introductory talk. This time, Mark will go into details about monitoring your secret management infrastructure,
    so you can be sure your secrets are rotated. He will also offer alternative solutions to Kubernetes secrets if you are in no position to trust your provider.

  description: |
    The growing adoption of containerization and container orchestration has amplified the need for secure and controlled distribution of container images.
    This talk delves into the process of distributing private container images and OCI artifacts,
    examining the strengths and weaknesses of various solutions in relation to specific use cases,
    such as software sales and customized builds for clients.

    We compare different approaches, beginning with hosted registries that provide cost-effectiveness, streamlined implementation,
    and minimal maintenance, although they possess inherent limitations. Subsequently, we investigate a range of open-source solutions,
    from turnkey options that are user-friendly and low-maintenance but may offer limited integration capabilities,
    to constructing fully bespoke solutions using low-level building blocks, which grant extensive customization possibilities.

    Join us as we navigate the ever-evolving world of constructing private container distribution using open-source software
    and assist you in determining the most appropriate approach tailored to your unique needs and requirements.
