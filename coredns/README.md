## Repo Organization

If you have your slides already online or hosted someplace else, just leave a link in the table of contents. If you want to submit actual slides to this repo submit your slides via a Pull Request, for now we're organizing by _author name_, so just toss them in a subdirectory under your last name.

**FORMAT**: We prefer if your slides were in a reusable format, such as Google Slides or whatever CSS/HTML/JS framework you prefer so it's easier to consume.

Please make sure your content is under the Apache v2.0 or CC-BY license so we can easily share and reuse the content.
